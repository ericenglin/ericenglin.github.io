## Harvard Graduate Coursework

**Overall Description:** I am currently a graduate student in the Masters in Public Policy program at Harvard Kennedy School. In my time at Harvard, I have taken courses in various statistics, machine learning, and data science courses. Each of these had some kind of course assignments and final project that are detailed below.

### Machine Learning for Policymakers

This course involved an overview of many machine learning models and processes. Specific models include: linear and logistic regression, decision trees (random forest, boosting, bagging), support vector machines and classifiers, lasso and ridge regressions. We also touched on neural networks at a high level and did some basic classification.

Major projects include: [NYC Gentrification Predictions](https://github.com/ericenglin/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Assignments/tree/master/NYC%20Gentrification%20Prediction) and [Costa Rica Household Poverty Prediction](https://github.com/ericenglin/Costa-Rica-Poverty-Prediction).

All code in R.


### Data Science

This course involves many similar machine learning models as the previous course, but it also includes more of an emphasis on data cleaning, wrangling, and other methods of data collection like webscraping. All homework files demonstrating use of models are [in this repo](https://github.com/ericenglin/Data-Science-Assignments).

Final project involves using social media data to predict election outcomes. That can be found in [in this repo](https://github.com/jschneids13/CS109a-Group-81-Final-Project).
