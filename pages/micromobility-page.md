## Micromobility Text Analysis

**Project description:** This is a simple webscraper that builds a word cloud and makes bigrams & trigrams. All code can be found in jupyter notebook file. Articles have been compiled throughout the summer of 2019. This analysis uses a subset of these articles as a quick attempt to find useful information. All articles can be found in the xlsx file or in the jupyter notebook.
