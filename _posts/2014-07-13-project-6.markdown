description: This is a web scraper to download PDFs on Amtrak usage at stations across the U.S. from 2012-2018. Raw PDFs were downloaded at the station level and the state level (both csvâ€™s included here). From there, the program will scrape the graph for the last 6 years of ridership from each PDF document. Some stations have discontinued services in the last 6 years, and the program will flag these stations. Final data is posted as data visuals. Final visuals shown at <a href="https://ericenglin.github.io/Amtrak-Web-Scraper/">this link</a>.<br><br>In 2021, the final strategic plan was posted online and sent to Congress. The public version is detailed on <a href = "https://www.transportation.gov/NACTTI">this U.S. Department of Transportation website</a>
