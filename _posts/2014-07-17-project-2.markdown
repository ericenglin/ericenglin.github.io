description: This analysis looks into the property dataset on Cambridge Open Data portal. The maps created and analysis were used for Harvard Graduate School of Design's Land Use Law Zoning Code Exercise where we are meant to analyze an existing zoning code and propose beneficial changes. My paper is about the eligible lots for ADUs and how criteria can be relaxed to encourage development. Full repo is available <a href = "https://ericenglin.github.io/cambridge-property-analysis/"> here</a>.
