description: This project created a webscraper and simple natural language processing search to identify and analyze the transportation information on the 400 U.S. national park websites. It uses a chromedriver webscraper that looks at over 10,000 total NPS websites. The NLP algorithm uses these web pages to carry out a keyword and key phrase search and scoring criteria. Full repo available  <a href="https://github.com/ericenglin/NPS-Website-Scrape">at this location</a>.
